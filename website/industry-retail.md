# Agentic AI for retail and e-commerce.

Retail runs on real-time decisions — what to show a shopper, whether an item is in stock, how to price it, how to fulfill it — at traffic that swings from quiet to peak in minutes. The Akka Agentic AI Platform lets retailers build and run AI agents that act on live customer, catalog, and inventory data.

| Stat | Label |
|---|---|
| **+20%** | Web conversion (Walmart) |
| **400K/hr** | Page views at peak |
| **2×** | Faster ML predictions (Swiggy) |

## Why retail is different — every decision is in the moment

A shopper won't wait. Personalization, inventory, pricing, and fulfillment decisions have to land in milliseconds, against catalogs of hundreds of thousands of items, through demand that spikes on promotions and holidays.

- **Latency is conversion.** Slow pages and slow recommendations are lost carts.
- **Demand is bursty.** Promotions and seasonal peaks multiply traffic without warning.
- **Scale is the catalog.** Personalization runs across hundreds of thousands of SKUs and titles.
- **Margins are thin.** Cost per prediction and per session has to fall as volume grows.

## The platform, applied to retail — built for the moment of decision

- **Real-time — Millisecond personalization.** Match shoppers to products, prices, and content on live signals — no pre-computed batch results.
- **Elastic scale — Peak without pre-provisioning.** Scales with promotional and seasonal demand and back down.
- **ML serving — Predictions at scale.** Serve thousands of predictions per second per model with batching and feature reuse built in.
- **Efficiency — Lower cost per session.** Serve more requests on the same footprint.

## Governance — consumer AI, transparent and fair

Retail runs AI directly against consumers — recommendations, pricing, and profiling that regulators increasingly govern for transparency and fairness. Akka tracks 189 AI regulations worldwide, mapped to enforceable controls and monitored as they change.

- **AI governance:** EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001
- **Consumer & transparency:** EU AI Act Art. 5 & 50, GDPR, CCPA / CPRA
- **Biometrics:** Illinois BIPA, Washington biometric
- **Regional AI acts:** Colorado AI Act, Texas TRAIGA, Brazil AI Bill, Japan AI Act

## Safe & governed by default — control built into every agent action

- **Guardrails — Block unsafe outputs.** Runtime filters catch prohibited or unsafe content before an agent can act on it.
- **Sanitizers — Strip sensitive data.** Personal and confidential data is automatically removed from what agents read and write.
- **Evaluations — Checked in real time.** Every agent action is checked inline — pass, block, or flag — so an unsafe action never executes.
- **HITL / HOTL — People stay in control.** High-stakes actions escalate to a person; halt switches let a human stop an agent instantly.
- **Testing gates — Proven before it ships.** Scenario, replay, stress, and adversarial red-team tests gate every change before production.
- **Logging & retention — A record that holds up.** Every decision is written to a tamper-evident, hash-chained log, retained for years with legal hold.

## Where agents act in retail (use cases)

- **Recommendations & discovery** — Real-time, per-shopper recommendations across the full catalog.
- **Real-time inventory & availability** — Accurate, live stock and availability across channels and stores.
- **Order & fulfillment orchestration** — Route, batch, and fulfill orders reliably under peak load and strict SLAs.
- **Dynamic pricing & promotions** — Price and promote in real time against demand, inventory, and competition.
- **Demand forecasting** — Forecast demand at SKU and store granularity to plan inventory and staffing.
- **Customer service & fraud** — Resolve orders and returns and contain fraud in real time on live account state.

## Proof — retail already runs on Akka

**Walmart · Retail & E-commerce — Web conversion up 20 percent on commodity infrastructure.**
- **+20%** web conversion
- **+98%** mobile orders in 4 weeks
- **400K/hr** page views at peak

Walmart rebuilt its web and mobile stack on Akka, moved ~40% of compute to commodity servers, cut page-load times 36%, and lowered long-term web infrastructure cost by up to 50%. [Read the story](https://akka.io/customers/walmart)

**Swiggy · Food Delivery & Logistics — ML prediction latency cut in half at city scale.**
- **144→71 ms** P99 prediction latency
- **5,000+** predictions/sec per model
- **1 min** city-scale assignment SLA

Swiggy built its Data Science Platform on Akka, halved compute per prediction with micro-batching and feature reuse, and now scores every order-and-rider pairing inside a strict one-minute SLA. [Read the story](https://akka.io/customers/swiggy)
